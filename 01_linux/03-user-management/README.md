# LINUX USER MANAGEMNET
This section will give the necessary knowledge to understand the `User Managemnet` in `Linux`. Let's talk about how a typical
set up of our laptop is when we newly purchase one. Ideally we will create a user and a password, and with that we can
start to use the laptop and create different things, install  various apps. Also, we can decided to create another user for guest on the same laptop for guest usage.

It's a bit similar in Linux, also you create user in Linux, however users doesn't have all permissions by default. 
We are going to go through different user mnanagemet commands to allow us create a new user, create a new group, add that user into the group, delete the user and
delete the group.

We will begin with some theoretical way to carry out this administartive task, at the end we highlight steps to carry out this so as to do this practically, please you will need your 
Linux environment set up and ready, please follow the instructions [HERE](https://github.com/coredataengineers/CDE-BOOTCAMP/blob/main/01_linux/02-linux-setup/README.md) to launch your Linux environment.
