## Docker Architecture

The architecture of Docker explains how Docker works under the hood.

### What is Docker (In Simple Terms)?
Imagine you have a recipe for a delicious dish. You want to make it on your friend’s gas, your office’s gas, and even in a rented apartment and you want it to taste the same every time. But every kitchen is different.

Docker is like a portable *kitchen-in-a-box*. It lets developers package their application (the recipe) along with everything it needs to run (ingredients, cookware, spices) into one neat box (called a container) — so it runs the same way anywhere.

## The Building Blocks of Docker Architecture
Docker has several key components that work together to make this magic happen:
1. Docker Client
* Analogy: You are the chef placing an order.
* The Docker client is what you use to interact with Docker — usually via the docker command in your terminal.
* It talks to the Docker Engine (daemon) to carry out your instructions.
2. Docker Daemon (Engine)
* Analogy: The kitchen staff who prepares what you ordered.
* Runs in the background and manages Docker objects (containers, images, networks, etc.).
3. Docker Images
* Analogy: A blueprint or recipe.
* A Docker image is a read-only template with instructions for creating a container (e.g., an image with Python installed).
4. Docker Containers
* Analogy: A dish prepared using the recipe.
* A running instance of a Docker image. It is isolated and includes everything needed to run the app.
5. Dockerfile
* Analogy: A written set of steps for the recipe.
* A plain-text file with instructions on how to build a Docker image.
6. Docker Compose
* Analogy: A dinner set with multiple recipes (e.g., rice + soup + drink).
* Used to define and run multi-container Docker applications using a YAML file (```docker-compose.yml```).
7. Docker Hub / Registry
* Analogy: A public cookbook library.
* A place to store and share Docker images (e.g., Docker Hub).

### How They All Work Together
When you run this:
```bash
docker run -it python:3.10
```
Here's what happens:
1.	Docker Client sends the command to the Docker Daemon.
2.	Daemon checks if it has the image locally. If not, it pulls it from Docker Hub.
3.	The image is used to spin up a container.
4.	You get a terminal inside that container (Python shell).
