# Introduction

If you are here, I want to give you a heartwarming congratulations, because you are about to explore and understand the beautiful world of `Apache Kafka`

We won't go straight into it, I would like you to understand what happened before event streaming as we know it today.

## Life Without Kafka: The Problem Kafka Solves
Before Kafka, organizations often relied on direct communication between services or traditional data pipelines. These setups were hard to manage, unreliable, and not designed for real-time needs.

Let’s explore what life looked like without Kafka — and why even batch processing couldn’t solve the full picture.

### Option 1: Direct Communication Between Systems
Each service is wired to talk directly to another.

**Problems**:
* Tightly coupled: Changes in one service break the others.
* Fragile: If the destination is down, messages are lost or delayed.
* Complex: Adding a new consumer means touching the producer code.


### Option 2: Traditional Message Queues
Message queues (like RabbitMQ or ActiveMQ) improved decoupling but still had limits:

* Messages are often removed after being read.
* Not built for high throughput or large-scale replay.
* Lacked storage—used for moving data, not persisting it.

### Option 3: Batch Processing
Some teams turned to batch processing pipelines, like using cron jobs or ETL tools (Extract, Transform, Load) to move data periodically:

**Problems with Batch Processing**:

| Issue                         | Why It's a Problem                                                |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Delayed Data**            | Batches often run every hour or daily. You get outdated insights. |
| **Rigid Scheduling**       | Missed jobs = missed data. Dependencies are brittle.              |
| **Poor Real-Time Support** | No way to react instantly to new events.                          |
| **Not Scalable**           | Moving millions of rows in batches causes spikes and failures.    |
| **Replay is Hard**         | You can’t “go back” unless you re-run the entire job.             |
| **No Streaming**            | Not suitable for dashboards, alerts, or event-driven systems.     |


**Example:**
<br> Imagine you work at a ride-sharing company.
<br> Riders open the app. Drivers complete trips.
<br> A dashboard shows active drivers in real time.

If you use batch processing, you’ll only update the dashboard every 15 minutes. That’s too late as users expect instant updates.


## Kafka: The Real-Time Streaming Solution
Kafka is built to solve these limitations. It acts as a central pipeline where producers publish events and consumers subscribe to them.

Here’s what it looks like with Kafka

          +----------------+
          | Orders Service |
          +----------------+
                  |
                  v
             [ Kafka Topic ]  <--- Event stream
                  |
        +--------------------------+
        | Payment Service          |
        | Inventory Service        |
        | Analytics Dashboard      |
        +--------------------------+


# Apache Kafka Overview

Apache Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform designed for high-throughput, fault-tolerant, and scalable real-time data pipelines. Originally developed at LinkedIn and later open-sourced, Kafka has become the de facto standard for building modern data streaming architectures.

Confluent Kafka is an enterprise-grade distribution of Apache Kafka that adds additional tools, services, and APIs to simplify deployment, monitoring, security, and integration.
