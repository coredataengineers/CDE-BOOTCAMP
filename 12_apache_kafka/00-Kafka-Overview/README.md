# Apache Kafka Overview

Apache Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform designed for high-throughput, fault-tolerant, and scalable real-time data pipelines. Originally developed at LinkedIn and later open-sourced, Kafka has become the de facto standard for building modern data streaming architectures.

Confluent Kafka is an enterprise-grade distribution of Apache Kafka that adds additional tools, services, and APIs to simplify deployment, monitoring, security, and integration.
