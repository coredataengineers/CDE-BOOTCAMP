# Introduction

If you are here, I want to give you a heartwarming congratulations, because you are about to explore and understand the beautiful world of `Apache Kafka`

We won't go straight into it, I would like you to understand what happened before event streaming as we know it today.

## Life Without Kafka: The Problem Kafka Solves
Before Kafka, organizations often relied on direct communication between services or traditional data pipelines. These setups were hard to manage, unreliable, and not designed for real-time needs.

Let’s explore what life looked like without Kafka — and why even batch processing couldn’t solve the full picture.

**Option 1**: Direct Communication Between Systems
Each service is wired to talk directly to another.

[Orders Service] ---> [Payments Service]  
[Website]       ---> [Analytics System]  
[Mobile App]    ---> [Dashboard Service]

**Problems**:
<br> 1. Tightly coupled: Changes in one service break the others.
<br> 2. Fragile: If the destination is down, messages are lost or delayed.
<br> 3. Complex: Adding a new consumer means touching the producer code.





# Apache Kafka Overview

Apache Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform designed for high-throughput, fault-tolerant, and scalable real-time data pipelines. Originally developed at LinkedIn and later open-sourced, Kafka has become the de facto standard for building modern data streaming architectures.

Confluent Kafka is an enterprise-grade distribution of Apache Kafka that adds additional tools, services, and APIs to simplify deployment, monitoring, security, and integration.
